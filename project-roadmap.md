# Feature Roadmap for Jamie's Business Tracking Application

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Client Management

**Objective:** Establish the foundational infrastructure of your application and basic client management capabilities.

### Setup Next.js Project
- Initialize the Next.js application.
- Configure TypeScript for type safety (optional but recommended).

### Database Setup
- Choose a relational database like PostgreSQL.
- Setup Prisma as an ORM to facilitate database interactions.

### Authentication
- Implement authentication (consider using NextAuth.js for simplicity).
- Role-based access control: Admin, Manager, and Viewer.

### Client Management
- Basic CRUD operations for client data: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- Client dashboard to view all clients and their key information.

## Phase 2: Project Tracking and Analytics

**Objective:** Develop capabilities to track projects and provide analytics on projects and financial metrics.

### Project Management
- Project CRUD operations linked to clients.
- Status updates for projects (e.g., planning, ongoing, completed).

### Analytics
- Implement functionality to track cumulative dollars per client.
- Analyze which types of jobs bring in the most revenue.
- Visual representations (charts/graphs) for revenue and job types.

## Phase 3: Employee Management

**Objective:** Manage employee information, including salaries, skills, and project assignments.

### Employee Profiles
- CRUD operations for employee data.
- Ability to link employees to projects and track their contributions.

### Skill Tracking
- Add and manage skills for each employee.
- Skill-based project assignment (optional feature).

### Salary Management
- Track and update salary information.
- Generate reports on payroll expenses for financial planning.

## Phase 4: Invoicing and Advanced Analytics

**Objective:** Enable invoice creation for projects and enhance analytics with more detailed insights.

### Invoicing
- Generate invoices for completed projects.
- Customizable invoice templates.
- Options to send invoices directly to clients via email.

### Advanced Analytics
- Profitability analysis for different project types.
- Historical data comparison to identify trends over time.
- Enhanced dashboard with filters for different metrics and time periods.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Testing

**Objective:** Ensure the application is robust, secure, and ready for deployment.

### Testing
- Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Conduct end-to-end testing with Cypress or a similar tool.

### Deployment
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel (for Next.js) or another preferred service.
- Ensure the application is scalable and secure on deployment.

### Documentation
- Document the application setup, codebase, and user guide.
- Provide training materials for end-users.

## Maintenance and Iterative Improvement

**Objective:** Regularly update the application, fix issues, and potentially add new features based on user feedback.

### Feedback Loop
- Establish a system for collecting user feedback.
- Regularly update the application based on this feedback and emerging business needs.

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor performance and optimize as needed.
- Ensure data integrity and security with regular audits and updates.
